This is an update to the Forge Pick Block But For Tools mod to include tools from other mods.

It allows the Player to use the Pick Block like action to instead pick the tool that best breaks or saves the block. This action does not override the main Minecraft Pick Block action

To use the break feature hold "B" (default key binding) and middle click on the block to select the best breaking tool (prioritizes fortune).

To use the "save" feature hold "V" (default key binding) and middle click on the block to select the best silk touch tool.

To quick select the pickarang or flamerang press "Y" (default key binding)

To quick select the atomic disassembler press "X" (default key binding)
